	abstract = {Ampliconic genes are multicopy, with the majority found on sex chromosomes and enriched for testis-expressed genes. While ampliconic genes have been associated with the emergence of hybrid incompatibilities, we know little about their copy number distribution and their turnover in human populations. Here, we explore the evolution of human X- and Y-linked ampliconic genes by investigating copy number variation (CNV) and coding variation between populations using the Simons Genome Diversity Project. We develop a method to assess CNVs using the read depth on modified X and Y chromosome targets containing only one repetition of each ampliconic gene. Our results reveal extensive standing variation in copy number both within and between human populations for several ampliconic genes. For the Y chromosome, we can infer multiple independent amplifications and losses of these gene copies even within closely related Y haplogroups, that diversified \&lt; 50,000 years ago. Moreover, X- and Y-linked ampliconic genes seem to have a faster amplification dynamic than autosomal multicopy genes. Looking at expression data from another study, we also find that X- and Y-linked ampliconic genes with extensive CNV are significantly more expressed than genes with no CNV during meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (for both X and Y) and postmeiotic sex chromosome repression (for the Y chromosome only). While we cannot rule out that the XY-linked ampliconic genes are evolving neutrally, this study gives insights into the distribution of copy number within human populations and demonstrates an extremely fast turnover in copy number of these regions.},

There are numerous valuable and well-established variation resources, but collating and making sense of non-homogeneous, often large-scale data sets from disparate sources remains a challenge. Without a systematic catalogue of these data and appropriate query and annotation tools, understanding the genome sequence of an individual and assessing their disease risk is impossible. In Ensembl, we substantially solve this problem: we develop methods to facilitate data integration and broad access; aggregate information in a consistent manner and make it available a variety of standard formats, both visually and programmatically; build analysis pipelines to compare variants to comprehensive genomic annotation sets; and make all tools and data publicly available.}",

    abstract = "{The X-linked reproductive homeobox (RHOX) gene cluster encodes transcription factors preferentially expressed in reproductive tissues. This gene cluster has important roles in male fertility based on phenotypic defects of Rhox-mutant mice and the finding that aberrant RHOX promoter methylation is strongly associated with abnormal human sperm parameters. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of RHOX function in humans. Using gene expression profiling, we identified genes regulated by members of the human RHOX gene cluster. Some genes were uniquely regulated by RHOXF1 or RHOXF2/2B, while others were regulated by both of these transcription factors. Several of these regulated genes encode proteins involved in processes relevant to spermatogenesis; e.g. stress protection and cell survival. One of the target genes of RHOXF2/2B is RHOXF1, suggesting cross-regulation to enhance transcriptional responses. The potential role of RHOX in human infertility was addressed by sequencing all RHOX exons in a group of 250 patients with severe oligozoospermia. This revealed two mutations in RHOXF1 (c.515G \\&gt; A and c.522C \\&gt; T) and four in RHOXF2/2B (-73C \\&gt; G, c.202G \\&gt; A, c.411C \\&gt; T and c.679G \\&gt; A), of which only one (c.202G \\&gt; A) was found in a control group of men with normal sperm concentration. Functional analysis demonstrated that c.202G \\&gt; A and c.679G \\&gt; A significantly impaired the ability of RHOXF2/2B to regulate downstream genes. Molecular modelling suggested that these mutations alter RHOXF2/F2B protein conformation. By combining clinical data with in vitro functional analysis, we demonstrate how the X-linked RHOX gene cluster may function in normal human spermatogenesis and we provide evidence that it is impaired in human male fertility.}",

abstract="Gene expression patterns are a key feature in understanding gene function, notably in development. Comparing gene expression patterns between animals is a major step in the study of gene function as well as of animal evolution. It also provides a link between genes and phenotypes. Thus we have developed Bgee, a database designed to compare expression patterns between animals, by implementing ontologies describing anatomies and developmental stages of species, and then designing homology relationships between anatomies and comparison criteria between developmental stages. To define homology relationships between anatomical features we have developed the software Homolonto, which uses a modified ontology alignment approach to propose homology relationships between ontologies. Bgee then uses these aligned ontologies, onto which heterogeneous expression data types are mapped. These already include microarrays and ESTs. Bgee is available at http://bgee.unil.ch/",
